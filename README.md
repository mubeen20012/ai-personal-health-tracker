🧠 AI Personal Health TrackerMulti-Modal Heart Disease Risk Prediction System📺 Project DemoCheck out the full walkthrough of the application on my YouTube channel, Mubeen Tech:📌 Project OverviewThe AI Personal Health Tracker is an end-to-end artificial intelligence application designed to assess heart disease risk by combining multiple types of patient data into one unified prediction system.Instead of relying on a single data source, this project integrates:Clinical & demographic data (tabular)ECG time-series signalsChest X-ray imagesEach data type is processed using a specialized deep learning model, and their outputs are fused to produce a final, patient-level risk prediction.🎯 Project GoalsBuild a realistic, multi-modal AI system for healthcare.Apply ANN, CNN, and LSTM in a single unified pipeline.Practice end-to-end ML system development.Deliver interpretable risk levels with actionable recommendations.🚀 Key FeaturesMulti-modal AI system (tabular + image + time-series).Independent training of ANN, CNN, and LSTM models.Deep feature-level fusion for final prediction.Real-time inference via a Flask web application.Clear risk categorization and health recommendations.🧠 Model Architecture Overview1️⃣ ANN – Clinical & Demographic DataPurpose: Analyze structured patient data and generate meaningful feature embeddings.Sample Input Features: Age, BMI, Blood pressure, Cholesterol level, Gender.Architecture: Dense (128) → ReLU → Dropout → Dense (64) → Sigmoid.Performance: Accuracy ~90%.2️⃣ CNN – Chest X-ray AnalysisPurpose: Extract visual patterns from chest X-ray images indicating abnormalities.Model: Pre-trained MobileNetV2 (transfer learning).Input Size: 224 × 224 RGB images.Performance: Test Accuracy ~83%.3️⃣ LSTM – ECG Signal ProcessingPurpose: Analyze ECG time-series signals to detect abnormal heart rhythms.Architecture: Bidirectional LSTM (64 units) → LSTM (32 units).4️⃣ Fusion Model – Multi-Modal IntegrationPurpose: Combine insights from all three models (ANN, CNN, LSTM) using a concatenation layer followed by dense layers to produce the final risk score.📊 Risk InterpretationPrediction ProbabilityRisk LevelRecommendation≥ 0.75High RiskImmediate cardiologist consultation recommended0.45 – 0.74Moderate RiskLifestyle improvement and regular monitoring< 0.45Low RiskMaintain a healthy routine🛠️ Tech StackLanguage: PythonDeep Learning: TensorFlow / KerasData Science: Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, OpenCVWeb Framework: FlaskFrontend: HTML & CSS📦 Deployment StatusThe system is fully deployment-ready and can be hosted using:Render / Hugging Face SpacesDocker-based cloud services⚠️ DisclaimerThis project is intended for educational purposes only.
